Hello.
This is a responsive website designed by Ashish Shakya.
The website was designed to implement frontend development skills.
Therefore it is not connected to a database. And the images are stored locally.

The home page of the website displays a rotating slideshow of pictures with quotes.
You can either navigate to the images by clicking on gallery on the navbar or by scrolling down.
There are two galleries one for macro images and one for landscapes.
The About me page is designed in a way that the background image perspective moves when you scroll.

If the browser is resized to the size of a mobile phone screen the navbar changes accordingly.

All images used belong to Tresha Shakya.
